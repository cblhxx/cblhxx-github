00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:58,111
星际迷航还是星球大战好?
"Star Trek" or "Star Wars"?

144
00:06:58,146 --> 00:06:59,863
不! 两个没法一起比较!

星际迷航要比星球大战好
"Star Trek" is better than "Star Wars"

150
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:10,157
因为星际迷航是讲述探索,

00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:13,460
我的梦想, 我的目标, 我的激情就是把人类送到火星.

208
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,589
但因为我是个化学家... 我可能是个大靶子
But the fact that I'm a chemist... that puts a huge target on my back.

209

So I'm gonna kind of make myself look a little weak at first.

Bet I'm the only one here that can write backwards.

Maybe later on, I might divulge, like, "hey, by the way",

我们接下来怎么该做什么?
So, how are we gonna do this, guys?

242
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,375
我们就闲聊, 然后让队长做决定?
Are we just gonna talk and let the captains do their thing?

243
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:45,255
Chris: 这个决定很有趣.

我要告诉你我的所有信息.

我是个化学家.
I'm a chemist.

247

领导才能方面, Chris很可能是个很好的领袖.
From a leadership standpoint, Chris would be a stronger leader,

249
00:10:54,632 --> 00:10:56,249
但是Zack有我所缺少的.
but Zack has what I <i>don't</i> have.

250
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,968
我需要一个人来弥补我的不足...
I needed someone that balances my skills...

就是你.

你数学很强?

我跟你一起进4强怎么样. 好哇.

希望Zack不要告诉别人我是化学家.
Hopefuy, Zack doesn't tell anybody I'm a chemist.

255
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:11,147
如果他说了, 我们的联盟...

就没了.
Poof! Gone.

00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,150
这个会发光还是咋地?

Kayla, 你关于重启"星际迷航"有什么想法.
Kayla, your opinion on the reboot "Star Trek."

259
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:28,665
这是当你允许星球大战粉丝
It's what happens when you give a "Star Wars" fan

260
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,117
批评星际迷航时会发生的.
permission over "Star Trek."

你能以把一个宇宙飞船放到TMD海里去!
You can't put a starship under the freakin' ocean!

262
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:35,822
首战是要选队
The first Nerd War is to pick teams.

263
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:38,875
Zack是队长, Chris是另一个.
Zack is one captain, and Chris is the other one.

264
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:42,262
我们都在讨论, 这个大变化最后会是什么.
We've all been, like, talking, what this twist could be at the end,

265
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:44,931
因为我们知道这不可能跟去年一样.
'cause we know it can't be the same as last year's.

266
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:46,767
会不会先让我们选人
What if they're making us pick

267
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:49,686
最后剩下那个人可以自由选择队?
and then the person who's left out picks the teams?

268
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:51,638
实际上, 我也是这么想的.
Actually, that's kind of what I was thinking of.

269
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:53,640
我们不确定这个大变化会不会是根本就没变化.
We're not exactly sure if the twist is that there <i>is</i> no twist,

270
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:55,192
太复杂了.
so things are getting kind of complicated.

271
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:57,060
别人在哪... Zack在哪?
Where's the other... where's Zack?

272
00:11:57,111 --> 00:11:59,929
显然, 我会先选你.
Obviously, you're the person I want to pick first.

273
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,698
你觉着接下来我们应该选谁,
Who do you think is the person we should pick next,

274
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,400
如果我先选你了?
- if I pick you first? - It'd probably be...

275
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:05,035
叫什么来着? 对了.
- What's his face? - Yep.

276
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:07,371
我和Zack有个计划.
Going into the Nerd War, Zack and I have a plan.

277
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:08,905
谁会是最后剩下的?
Who would be the last one picked?

278
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:10,707
我觉着会是Kelsey.
I almost think Kelsey.

279
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:14,044
只要没有SB搅局, 我们就安全.
As long as there's no, like, crazy monkey wrench, we're good.

280
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:16,830
我跟你说过我的职业是什么吗?
Do I mention what my actual profession is?

281
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:18,965
咱们现在就这样. 好.
- Let's keep that for now. - Okay.

282
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,801
好的. Cool.
- All right. - Cool.

283
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:24,421
集合
[Alarm blaring] Calling all nerds!

284
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:29,259
比赛马上就要开始了
A Nerd War of wits is about to commence!

285
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:32,813
Xander: 现在要开始选人了. 每一个吊丝的噩梦.
Xander: And now it's time to pick teams. This is every nerd's nightmare.

286
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:34,231
[Exhales nervously]

287
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,234
Chris and Zack!

288
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,019
Curtis.

289
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,821
- They're right there.
- [Laughs]

290
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:42,322
I'm sorry.

291
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:43,857
[Laughter]

292
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:50,097
Chris, Zack, 来披上你们队的斗篷.
Chris and Zack, join us and don your team cloaks.

293
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,184
Josh: Wow. [Laughs]

294
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:55,969
你们开始选择队友
You will pick your teammates

295
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,140
把斗篷披在队友的肩上.
by placing your team cloaks upon their shulders.

296
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:05,328
现在,　你们用经典的剪刀石头布
Now, you will engage in a spirited rock-paper-scissors

297
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,731
来决定谁先开始
for the right to go first.

298
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:10,083
Ck: 有无穷多个
Ck: There is a significant amount of just ways

299
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:12,586
去操作控制别人的策略.
you can kind of subtly manipulate someone.

300
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:13,887
剪刀, 石头, 布, 出手.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

301
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:16,590
就这样, １, 2, 3,　出手.
As in, 1, 2, 3, go. Okay. That'll work.

302
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:18,759
我觉着有可能
I was kind of maybe hoping just a little bit

303
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,011
我这样跟他说
that if I did that... rock, paper, scissors...

304
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:24,047
他潜意识中会觉着, "我应该出石头".
that maybe, subconsciously, he'd be like, "I should pick rock."

305
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:27,734
Ohh. All right.

306
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:30,320
布包石头.
Covers rock. All right.

307
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:33,056
你的策略是什么?
What is your strategy?

308
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:35,392
我需要选择一个
I need to pick someone right now

309
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:38,195
可以弥补我的不足的人.
who really complements my weaknesses.

310
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:39,830
你可以开始了.
You may proceed.

311
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:42,866
[Sighs]

312
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,918
Nicole: 如果他按照原计划,
Nicole: I knew I was the first one being picked,

313
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:46,953
我相信我会是第一个被选中的.
so as long as he sticks to the plan, we're good.

314
00:13:51,342 --> 00:13:53,126
- Aah! - [Laughs]

315
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:55,345
谢谢!
Yellow! Yellow! Thank you!

316
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:59,616
Zack第一个选择了Nicole, 让我感到很意外
Once Zack picked Nicole, it was kind of a shock to me

317
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:02,652
因为她一点儿也不出众
because she didn't really stand out.

318
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:07,157
我本以为他会选择一个高端的工程师, 但Nicole凭啥?
I thought he'd go more for the hard-core engineer, but Nicole?

319
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:11,094
Chris, 轮到你选了.
Chris, it's your turn to make your first pick.

320
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:14,698
Chris: 我要组一个均衡形的团队. 我需要一个游戏达人.
Chris: I need a well-rounded team. I need a gamer on my team.

321
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:17,784
我需要有一个人善于表演, 一个电工.
I need a performer on my team and an electrician on my team.

322
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,420
我该选谁呢?
And how am I supposed to pick and choose?

323
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,106
跟我头发很配.
Matches my hair.

324
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:24,207
Nicole.

325
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:26,910
[Indistinct whispering]

326
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,913
这个是Zack决定的, 我也没什么意见.
This was Zack's decision, but I'm okay with it.

327
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:31,381
我会先按照计划行事.
I'll stick to the plan for now.

328
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:33,667
Nicole: 欢迎加入黄队.
- Nicole: Come join the yellow side. - Whoo.

329
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:34,951
[Chuckles] Yeah.

330
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,922
我还没被选. 开始有点儿紧张了.
I'm not picked yet. Starting to get a little nervous.

331
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:40,824
我现在有点儿宠物小精灵的感觉.
I feel like a pokémon with a special condition.

332
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:43,126
Katie, 你可以选人了.
Katie, you may make your pick.

333
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:45,428
傻站在这里太糟糕了
It's just an awful feeling just standing there

334
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,964
不知道花落谁家, 自己会不会落选.
and not knowing if you're gonna get picked or not.

335
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:51,067
- Ah! - Jack.

336
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:53,103
Xander: 斗篷每抖一下,
Xander: Every clink of the cloak,

337
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:55,822
我就感觉会披在我身上.
you think that it's gonna be laid upon you.

338
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,307
但并没有.
- And then it wasn't. - Brian.

339
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:01,311
然后我默念, "选我, 选我, 选我!"
I'm just going, "please, please, please... pick me."

340
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,164
然后他就选了!
And he does!

341
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:05,699
Yeah!

342
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:09,119
他把他那灵巧的手臂环保在我伟岸的身躯.
He manages to get those short, little arms around my big, tall body.

343
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:11,988
Josh, 你开始选了.
Josh, make your pick.

344
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:13,886
Kelsey: 我本以为我会被秒选.
Kelsey: I kind of thought I'd get picked sooner.

345
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:15,892
我觉着我的特长独一无二.
I thought what I have is kind of unique,

346
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:18,795
中文有句话, [木办法]
but the Chinese have a saying, you know [Speaking Chinese]

347
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:22,032
意思是, "木办法"
And that literally means "there's nothing else that can be done."

348
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:28,104
Oh! Oh, God.

349
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,890
还剩下俩人
And then there were two.

350
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:34,144
大家, 我并不知道这个大变化是什么.
Okay, guys, I don't know the twist.

351
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:37,364
Chris: 在Kelsey和Kayla之间很难抉择
Chris: Choosing between Kelsey and Kayla is very difficult

352
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:41,451
上一季最后就有一个. 
because last season, there was a twist to the nerd challenge.

353
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:44,371
Bobby和Chrtis知道我们知道上季的改变
Bobby and Curtis know that we know there's a twist

354
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,389
并且他们还特别指出了
to that challenge, and they told us,

355
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:49,259
所以这次会发生什么很让我紧张.
so it's unnerving what's about to happen.

356
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:51,887
我可能会崩溃.
If we get broken up, it's fine.

357
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:54,965
紫队, 请选择最后一个队员.
Purple team, you may make your final pick.

358
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:11,231
木办法
[Speaking Chinese]

359
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,285
被剩下的感觉太受伤了.
When you're left out, it really does hurt.

360
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:17,854
你本以为找到了知己
You know, you think you found your friends,

361
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:21,491
但你的知己并不把你当作朋友.
and then your friends don't always turn out to be your friends.

362
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:24,427
心情五味杂陈
It's a very complex way to feel.

363
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:26,896
Brian: 我为Kelsey感到难过.
Brian: I feel a little bit bad for Kelsey.

364
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:29,282
但Kelsey是个未知数.
On the other hand, Kelsey's the big question now.

365
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,769
我们并不清楚他有什么特别之处.
We don't know what kind of power, if any, she's gonna have.

366
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:34,070
大大的问号.
It's all a big mystery.

367
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:35,905
- Kelsey. - Yeah.

368
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:40,961
上一季, 最后落选的人
Last season, the person who was not picked for either team

369
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,246
有至高的权利.
was given all the power.

370
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:46,967
因为没有什么比没人要更宅的了.
Because there's nothing nerdier than not getting picked.

371
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:48,852
是的, 我知道.
Yes, sir. I'm familiar with this.

372
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:51,021
很受伤吧.
It hurts. Right?

373
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:52,472
很疼, 我们知道.
- It does. - We've been there.

374
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:54,107
但是还有.
But here's the thing.

375
00:16:55,359 --> 00:17:02,365
还有一个比没人要更宅的, 你们知道是什么吗?
Do you the one thing that is even nerdier than not getting picked?

376
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
什么?
What?

377
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:08,371
什么也没有!
- Nothing! - [Chuckles]

378
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:13,910
没有什么比剩下更宅的了!
<i>Nothing</i> is nerdier than not getting picked!

379
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:17,514
所以Kelsey
So, you, Kelsey...

380
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:19,449
你有无上的权力!
Have all the power!

381
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:22,252
实际上, 比上季的更大.
In fact, you have even <i>more</i> power.

382
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:25,555
是的.
That's right.

383
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,427
现在你可以选择
Because now <i>you</i> have to choose

384
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:40,537
任意一位选手, 永远从Nerdvana消失.
who you would like to see banished from Nerdvana right now for good.

385
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:46,943
大家好!
Hey, everyone!

386
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:58,031
现在Kelsey, 你要选择
Now, you, Kelsey, have to choose

387
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:05,939
你想从Nerdvana淘汰谁.
who you would like to see banished from Nerdvana right now for good.

388
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:08,925
大家面面相觑...
We're all just looking at each other like...

389
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,410
大家!
Hey, everyone! [Giggles]

390
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:13,280
世上最惨.
Worst... Twist... Ever.

391
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:17,200
你要送谁回家?
Who would you choose to send home?

392
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,986
命悬一线.
Lives hang in the balance.

393
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:23,456
本女王大权在手, 梦想成真.
It's like a dream come true 'cause I've always wanted to be queen. You get power.

394
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:27,327
我可以听到我的心在"砰砰砰"的跳.
I could just feel my heart go, you know, "pow-pow-pow-pow-pow."

395
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:30,814
我掌握着每个人的命运.
Your lives hang in my balance.

396
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:34,301
我最后没有选她,
I was the last one to betray her by not picking her,

397
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:36,453
她可能会报复我.
so I'm in jeopardy of going home.

398
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:39,205
我该选...
I am going to go with...

399
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,374
根据去年的情况,
Based on data from last season,

400
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:44,477
聪明的选手会被早早淘汰.
it seems that the smart people tend to be kicked out quickly.

401
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:46,079
所以我有危险.
That makes me a target.

402
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:48,248
Nicole.

403
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,952
无意冒犯, 多一个少一个Nicole也没什么区别.
No offense. We could lose Nicole and not really notice.

404
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:54,471
不好意思.
I do apologize.

405
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:58,892
Curtis: 好吧, Nicole, 跟大家告别.
Curtis: All right, Nicole, say your goodbyes.

406
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:04,030
我现在想法很乱.
There's so many coulda, woulda, shouldas going in my head right now.

407
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:05,265
Thanks.

408
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:08,401
或许我不应该那么低调.
Maybe I should have said my strengths.

409
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:10,570
没想到会那么快就回家了.
I didn't think I'd be going home this quickly.

410
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:12,155
Oops. [Chuckles]

411
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:14,608
Zack: 全完了.
Zack: This meta thing screwed everything up.

412
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:18,144
我和Nicole的联盟是赢得冠军的关键.
My alliance with Nicole was going to help me in this competition.

413
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:20,113
我现在真的不想离开,
At the same time, I sure didn't want to go home,

414
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:21,387
so I'm happy, but I'm <i>not</i> happy.

415
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:24,150
So, this is...
A frustrating thing.

416
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:30,290
Nicole, while you will not be
crowned king of the nerds...

417
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,208
- Curtis?
- Hm?

418
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:34,928
You know, there technically

419
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:37,631
is something nerdier
than not being picked.

420
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:40,967
Katie: We have another twist.

421
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:42,969
Whooooooo.

422
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:48,341
It's nerdier to be kicked out by
somebody who wasn't even on a team.

423
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:51,277
Bobby, you're right.

424
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:53,346
[Laughs] Stop the presses!

425
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:54,447
[Exhales deeply]

426
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:58,068
That means, Nicole...

427
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,121
You are the nerdiest
of all nerds!

428
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,405
Oh, my God.

429
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:08,495
And you have won
this Nerd War of wits!

430
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,163
Whoo-hoo!

431
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:12,499
Thank you for
scaring the bejesus out of me.

432
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,300
It's just our job.

433
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:18,505
Nicole, you will now choose
the winning team.

434
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,390
You will be joining that team.

435
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:21,474
Oh, gosh.

436
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:25,061
I'm gonna have to go...

437
00:20:26,063 --> 00:20:27,597
back to my home team.

438
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:30,383
- The gold team.
- I want to join the gold team.

439
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:34,571
Gold team... You have
won this Nerd War!

440
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:36,439
Yeah!

441
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,625
Nicole coming back is like one
of my favorite pokémon items...

442
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:40,460
the revive.

443
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:43,229
She comes right back up from
the ashes and joins the fight,

444
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:46,099
and I am so glad she chose
to come back to our team.

445
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:49,069
You are also going to
have to pick someone

446
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:52,572
from the winning team
to go to the losing team.

447
00:20:57,678 --> 00:20:59,262
I'll trade it with you, Kelsey.

448
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:00,714
Understandable.

449
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:03,450
Hey, Kelsey, how do you like
my reversal charm?

450
00:21:03,484 --> 00:21:05,301
Isn't it so cool?

451
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:09,472
Curtis: Purple team,
as the losers of this Nerd War,

452
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:10,940
you are in peril.

453
00:21:10,975 --> 00:21:15,395
Two of your members are going to
be selected to go to the Nerd-Off.

454
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:18,982
You will be picking
one of those two people.

455
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,284
Gold team will be selecting
the other person.

456
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:24,537
You have 24 hours to decide.

457
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:28,107
And while you're at it,
name your teams.

458
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,109
Good luck!

459
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:32,445
Zack: [Laughing] Oh yeah!

460
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,713
Meta.

461
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:37,383
- Jack: All right.
- Whoo-hoo!

462
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:38,718
We have endured.

463
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:42,005
I am quite relieved
that I have endured.

464
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:45,458
Zack: We have completely triumphed,
and we are the gold team.

465
00:21:45,476 --> 00:21:47,093
So, so happy!

466
00:21:47,127 --> 00:21:50,313
- Nicole, I was, like, so worried.
- I'm shaking.

467
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:52,265
You can't touch us, purple.
We're safe.

468
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:55,301
Kayla: [Sighs] Couch time.

469
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,488
Having two teammates
go into the Nerd-Off...

470
00:21:58,572 --> 00:21:59,656
it sucks.

471
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,474
Can I say "sucks"? [Laughs]

472
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:04,644
Well, I'll start by saying "welcome
to the team. We love you."

473
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:07,530
I didn't mean, you know,
to condemn everyone, but...

474
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:08,715
No, it's fine.

475
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:11,618
We love you! It's the game.

476
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:15,255
Kelsey: There's a good chance I'm
gonna be in the Nerd-Off tomorrow.

477
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:18,591
I jumped from, you know,
the frying pan into the fire.

478
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,294
I think the first question
we got to think is,

479
00:22:21,328 --> 00:22:24,047
- how are they going to look at...
- Who are they gonna pick?

480
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:28,051
Mary Kate: All right, they've got
three science people on their team...

481
00:22:28,135 --> 00:22:30,220
Zack: So we don't want to
take one of those out, do we?

482
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:31,638
Well, I mean, do we want to?

483
00:22:31,672 --> 00:22:33,640
'Cause we know
they're gonna put in Kelsey.

484
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:35,174
Josh: You think so? Yes.

485
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:37,110
I honestly think
they're gonna send in Kelsey.

486
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:39,312
She's kind of reserved,
kind of quiet.

487
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:41,347
She thinks outside the box
a lot.

488
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:43,716
I kind of compare myself
to a mongoose

489
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:47,237
because they're cute, they're
Fluffy, and they're vicious.

490
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:50,240
I don't know whether we need to
take out their smartest player.

491
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,324
Chris is pretty bright.

492
00:22:51,358 --> 00:22:54,360
The one thing I do know is
that Zack will get his way.

493
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:56,329
I am moderately nervous.

494
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:57,797
He's either gonna choose me

495
00:22:57,832 --> 00:23:00,533
or he's going to choose
one of the creative types.

496
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:04,537
I wish I was not the team
captain for the first Nerd War.

497
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:07,106
Because of that,
I have a huge target on my back.

498
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:08,508
He's a very analytical person.

499
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,593
He does not have
a lot of creative skills.

500
00:23:10,678 --> 00:23:12,428
What's the heart, you know?
Like, where can we...

501
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:14,230
well, it'll either be
Chris or Katie.

502
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:16,216
I'm intimidated
by any of the competitors

503
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,101
that have a knowledge
of science or math

504
00:23:18,185 --> 00:23:20,603
because it is a realm
that I just don't understand.

505
00:23:20,654 --> 00:23:22,488
I'm gonna do a stat table.

506
00:23:22,556 --> 00:23:25,275
So, let's see...
science, engineering, math...

507
00:23:25,326 --> 00:23:27,694
We made a stat sheet
for everybody

508
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:30,530
because I rank algorithms
for a living.

509
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:32,665
Does Brian play
video and/or board games?

510
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,335
Actually, we could go
much farther than this.

511
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:38,705
I could show my partial
rank-list preference algorithms

512
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:40,373
and things like that.

513
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:42,408
But I can't show off too much.
Word might get out.

514
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:44,627
This is why I'm glad I'm in
the company of numbers people.

515
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:47,513
Yeah, numbers are pretty much
all I do. [Laughs]

516
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,353
Brian: I think that
whoever the gold team picks...

517
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,138
it's kind of irrelevant
to who we pick.

518
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:57,390
The other, kind of "random" way
that we could do it

519
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,609
is to not talk about it
and then just vote tomorrow.

520
00:23:59,643 --> 00:24:02,395
Honestly, I kind of like the
idea of just voting tomorrow.

521
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:03,696
Xander:
I feel like the purple team...

522
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:05,899
we are level-headed
about how we feel,

523
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:08,268
how we want the game
to be played.

524
00:24:08,302 --> 00:24:11,371
Chris: Okay, so, then let's say
tomorrow's vote is up to us...

525
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:15,208
choose our own adventure, pretty
much, for this round only.

526
00:24:15,242 --> 00:24:17,410
Xander: But when it comes down
to it, we're gonna find out

527
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:20,546
where people's allegiances lie
in our team.

528
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:21,781
No hard feelings.

529
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:33,531
- [Rooster crows]
- Curtis: All nerds to the throne room!

530
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:38,801
Nicole: Oh, my...

531
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:41,706
Brian: Today is our first
Nerd-Off, and it will be somebody

532
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,291
from the purple team against
somebody from the purple team.

533
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:47,244
It's like
Bruce Wayne's hall of armor.

534
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,830
Josh: It really feels like
this regal chamber

535
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:52,850
where the king would sit
and make his decisions.

536
00:24:56,722 --> 00:25:00,558
Welcome, nerds,
to this nerd elysium,

537
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:04,729
where we will be revealing
which two nerds

538
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:08,849
will be going to head-to-head
in our first Nerd-Off.

539
00:25:10,318 --> 00:25:14,655
The winner will stay
to compete for the crown

540
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:17,508
and the right to sit atop...

541
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:20,978
The throne of games!

542
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:22,913
[Cheers and applause]

543
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,536
Xander: This is the first time that
I've seen the throne of games,

544
00:25:28,587 --> 00:25:30,504
and it became
a real competition.

545
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,225
There's gonna be blood shed
to get to that chair.

546
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,927
The loser
goes home immediately.

547
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:40,214
But first, have you come up
with your team names?

548
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:42,733
Our team is...

549
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:44,334
The Midas...

550
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:45,352
- Touch...
- Touch...

551
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:46,637
- Attack!
- Attack!

552
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,339
There was even a presentation.

553
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,776
It's amazing.
And how did that come about?

554
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,011
We are the gold team,
and the Midas Touch

555
00:25:54,045 --> 00:25:56,313
is the ability
to turn things into gold.

556
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,449
The Touch Attack
is a dungeons & dragons term

557
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:01,952
for a direct physical attack
that penetrates armor.

558
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:05,356
Okay, a lot of work
went into that. Thank you.

559
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,039
Purple team.

560
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:10,711
Standing upon the shoulders
of giants, we are...

561
00:26:10,745 --> 00:26:12,913
All: The Titans of Rigel!

562
00:26:12,964 --> 00:26:15,466
[All snap fingers]

563
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,917
Last time, they just <i>told</i> us.

564
00:26:16,968 --> 00:26:18,552
[Laughter]

565
00:26:18,587 --> 00:26:20,638
Why The Titans of Rigel?
Could you explain that?

566
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:23,424
We are titans, individually, we
come together to work as a team,

567
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:26,811
and Rigel is the foot star
from the constellation orion.

568
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:29,513
And we are standing
on the shoulders of giants

569
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,817
to take our fields
to the next level.

570
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:35,319
All the past scientists
and philosophers

571
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:37,321
have propelled us
to this moment.

572
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:39,323
"Titans" also sounds
more badass than "giants."

573
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:41,592
And I'm sorry, Curtis,
but it's "rhy-jel."

574
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:43,577
- Uh, yes.
- Soft "G." Soft "G."

575
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:45,896
Yeah, soft "g." I know.
[Laughs]

576
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:48,415
We have your votes right here.

577
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,701
Team Midas Touch Attack...

578
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,469
Katie: I feel like the people
who are on the chopping block

579
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:54,338
are really Chris and Kayla.

580
00:26:54,372 --> 00:26:57,441
They're seen as these,
sort of, science powerhouses.

581
00:26:57,475 --> 00:27:00,744
By unanimous consent...

582
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:04,415
Chris, you will be going
to the Nerd-Off.

583
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:06,884
I'm hoping that the gold team
thinks I'm a threat,

584
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:09,470
rather than thinking
that I'm the weakest player.

585
00:27:09,521 --> 00:27:11,438
It's a compliment. His own
words, it's a compliment.

586
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:13,557
He is, you know...
he has a lot of skills,

587
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,402
and we want to take those out
early in the game.

588
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:19,563
Titans of Rigel...

589
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:24,101
Your first vote is...

590
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:25,703
Kelsey.

591
00:27:26,705 --> 00:27:28,339
Second vote...

592
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:30,441
Kelsey.

593
00:27:32,143 --> 00:27:34,011
Third vote...

594
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,963
Brian.

595
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,782
Fourth vote...

596
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,851
Kelsey.

597
00:27:40,886 --> 00:27:44,505
Kelsey: I have a big "X" on my back
just 'cause of what happened yesterday.

598
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:46,991
It's like,
"man! Again? Oh, joy."

599
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,977
- Kelsey...
- Yes.

600
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:52,062
You will be going
to the Nerd-Off.

601
00:27:52,097 --> 00:27:54,848
Well, after what happened yesterday,
I have a lot to prove, don't I?

602
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:57,467
And I'm going to
prove it today.

603
00:27:57,485 --> 00:27:59,770
Kelsey, Chris...
step forward, please.

604
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:04,508
Bend the knee.

605
00:28:06,077 --> 00:28:12,816
Today, you will be tested on your
knowledge of all things fantasy.

606
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:16,754
Bobby, the broom!

607
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:17,922
[Laughs]

608
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:19,506
I know that broom!

609
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:21,091
Kayla: Oh, wow.

610
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:25,963
Behold...

611
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:28,098
The nerd bolt.

612
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,800
[Laughter]

613
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:36,140
Today, you are going to be
doing battle in the skies...

614
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:37,507
Like Quidditch!

615
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:40,861
Curtis: In a game we call...

616
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:42,980
"Nerdditch."

617
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,581
[Laughter, applause]

618
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:47,618
I'm a huge "Harry Potter" fan.
I'm a Hufflepuff.

619
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,720
You have three hours
to prepare.

620
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:56,460
Whoever loses will become
he who must not be nerdy.

621
00:28:56,494 --> 00:28:57,411
[Laughter]

622
00:28:57,462 --> 00:28:59,997
May the best nerd win.

623
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:03,584
Kelsey: I'm gonna prove
that I deserve to be here.

624
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:07,171
I may not be an engineer
or a scientist,

625
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:10,741
but that doesn't mean that I can't
win this entire competition.

626
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:16,046
This is pretty much the worst challenge
for me, I would have to say.

627
00:29:16,064 --> 00:29:18,432
I am not a fan of fantasy.

628
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:19,731
Are you guys familiar
with "Game of Thrones"?

629
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,003
Not the books.

630
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:22,274
I've read all the books.
I haven't seen the show.

631
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:23,553
Okay.

632
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:25,789
I think to be a nerd,
you need to have a passion

633
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:27,908
in something
that can be useful to society,

634
00:29:27,942 --> 00:29:30,110
so that's why I'm actually
a fan of science fiction,

635
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:31,996
which is "Star Trek."

636
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:34,698
I don't think that he has
the ability to compete.

637
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:35,805
He knows Sci-Fi.

638
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:36,900
Mary Kate: He's got
that engineering mind.

639
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:38,836
But fantasy?
He's in the dark completely.

640
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,737
Like, this is exactly
how we planned it.

641
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:42,039
We rolled the 20.

642
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,843
If we get rid of Chris on their
team, we remove their foundation,

643
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,078
and you get rid of the foundation
of a building, it crumbles.

644
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:50,047
Midas Touch Attack!

645
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:51,849
[Both cheer]

646
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:53,717
Kelsey: I don't know.

647
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,653
When they say "fantasy,"
I'm like, "what <i>kind</i> of fantasy?

648
00:29:56,721 --> 00:30:00,758
Where is the fantasy?
Whose fantasy?"

649
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:02,976
Xander: Kelsey's definitely
the luna Lovegood.

650
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:05,195
She's off in her own world.
She's a little bit spacy.

651
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,866
I wouldn't be surprised if she
showed up with radish earrings.

652
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,452
How do you think they're gonna go with,
like, maybe, traditional fairy tales?

653
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:13,987
'Cause I have
a very good knowledge of...

654
00:30:14,072 --> 00:30:15,739
But that's what makes her
so dangerous,

655
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,207
is that you <i>don't</i> know
what's gonna happen.

656
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:19,109
Brian: Terry pratchett...

657
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,678
- how are you guys on Terry pratchett?
- Got to learn it.

658
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,080
Chris: I'm not panicking.

659
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:25,215
The last time
I've had to study something

660
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,518
was when I was trying to figure out
how to solve a rubik's cube...

661
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:29,136
I'm just going to try
to put as much

662
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,055
random information in my head
as possible.

663
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,639
And it requires a lot of focus,

664
00:30:32,724 --> 00:30:34,658
so I'll probably be using
those same resources

665
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:36,660
to help me out
in this challenge.

666
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:38,645
What about "Harry Potter"? Where
are you guys on "Harry Potter"?

667
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,111
Not good.

668
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:41,515
I've read all of the books,
but it's just been years.

669
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:44,485
Yes, 2007... I was
at space camp that year, yeah.

670
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:46,103
The results of this Nerd-Off

671
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,822
can really change
the dynamics of the team.

672
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:51,942
If we lose Chris,
we lose our strongest player.

673
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,977
It could be
a huge gravitational well

674
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:56,747
that's just gonna send us
flying in the wrong direction.

675
00:31:07,108 --> 00:31:10,544
Brian: Getting put in the Nerd-Off
is by no means a death sentence.

676
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:13,297
This is not facedown in
the guillotine, slice it off.

677
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,149
It's time to prove yourself.

678
00:31:19,604 --> 00:31:21,522
Jack: Mindy the pom pom girl

679
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,307
is probably the cutest girl
at this moment.

680
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:25,526
I'd take her out
to dinner and a movie.

681
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,562
[Singsong voice] That would be a
very nerdy relationship. Whoo-hoo!

682
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:33,000
Welcome to
our first Nerd-Off...

683
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:36,436
a magical game of Nerdditch.

684
00:31:36,454 --> 00:31:40,273
After correctly answering
a fantasy-based question,

685
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:45,245
you will have the chance
to fly on a broom down a course

686
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,549
while attempting
to throw vials of potion

687
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:53,253
into cauldrons
of varying point value.

688
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,589
The nerd with
the highest number of points

689
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:58,425
at the end of five rounds
is the winner.

690
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:01,345
The loser is banished forever.

691
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,014
Kayla:
Who knows who's gonna win?

692
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:06,350
This is going to be
up to whichever God out there

693
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:08,435
you believe in...
or non-God or whatever.

694
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:11,304
We come to our first question.

695
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:25,586
Dude, it's easy... Nimbus.
It's a broom. Duh.

696
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,254
Reveal your answer.

697
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:32,042
You are both correct.
The answer is Nimbus.

698
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:35,162
Kelsey,
you will be flying first.

699
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,097
[Cheers and applause]

700
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:39,216
[Dramatic accent]
Nerdditch is about to begin!

701
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:42,770
Kelsey: I don't throw potions
into a cauldron

702
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:45,055
as part of my daily routine,

703
00:32:45,106 --> 00:32:47,841
so I'm just gonna aim for one of
the big ones right off the start.

704
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:49,509
Go!

705
00:32:49,527 --> 00:32:51,111
[Contestants cheering]

706
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:54,615
Curtis:
She's approaching the 100.

707
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:58,452
She's passed.

708
00:32:58,486 --> 00:33:01,071
She must be eyeing one of the
larger-point-value cauldrons,

709
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:04,258
though she does have
up to six potion vials to throw.

710
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:05,743
[Indistinct shouting]

711
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:08,245
Oh! She just missed!

712
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:10,664
It just went by too fast.

713
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:13,584
Jack: I was not expecting so
much of a dexterity component.

714
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:15,753
Calculating relativity
is hard on paper.

715
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:18,872
Imagine calculating relativity
while flying on a broomstick.

716
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:21,759
Kayla: Chris! Fly! Katie: Whoo!

717
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,479
Chris is gonna be
a pivotal first elimination.

718
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:26,814
Ready...

719
00:33:26,848 --> 00:33:29,516
If he loses, we took out
a huge player right away.

720
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:31,351
Set... If he wins,

721
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,487
we're gonna fear him a whole lot
more than we already do.

722
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:34,688
Go!

723
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:36,440
Fly, nerd! Fly!

724
00:33:36,491 --> 00:33:37,574
[Contestants cheering]

725
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:39,860
Chris is preparing
his first vial,

726
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,412
looking at
that 100-point cauldron.

727
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:44,114
[Cheering]

728
00:33:44,165 --> 00:33:46,500
- That was a direct hit.
- It was a direct hit, by gosh.

729
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:48,502
Attempting the 500.

730
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:49,586
And it's off the rim!

731
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:51,171
[Cheers and applause]

732
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:52,405
Very good flight.

733
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:54,291
Boom goes the dynamite!

734
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:59,146
Now the score is Chris 100
and Kelsey with 0.

735
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:01,414
And now the second question.

736
00:34:16,698 --> 00:34:18,398
Zack: Is that a joke?

737
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,284
I can't believe
he's asking these questions.

738
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:21,768
Reveal!

739
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:24,271
The correct answer
is "slightly alive."

740
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,707
How?

741
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:28,608
What color
is the red fire truck?

742
00:34:28,626 --> 00:34:30,711
That was the level
of the question here.

743
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:32,279
This is crazy.

744
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:46,260
I'm sorry, Chris.
False is incorrect.

745
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:47,845
Kelsey, you get to fly.

746
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:49,730
Yay! [Laughs]

747
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:53,567
You shall not pass!

748
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,185
[Boom!]

749
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:57,354
That was my staff. Boom!

750
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:59,573
Curtis: Great chance here
to put some points on the board

751
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:00,941
and pull ahead of Chris.

752
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:01,942
Go!

753
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,644
Bobby: There she goes, Curtis.

754
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:06,479
Xander: Ganbatte!
Curtis: Here she goes.

755
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:10,500
She's approaching
the 100-point cauldrons, and...

756
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:14,538
Oh! She just missed it!

757
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:15,923
Bobby: That was so close.

758
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:17,925
Oh! And she missed the 250!

759
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,426
That's gonna hurt.

760
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:24,565
Missing was pretty frustrating,
and "kirai desu."

761
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,233
You know, I don't like it.

762
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:28,235
You know,
I don't like it at all.

763
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:29,469
Next question.

764
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:48,889
Brian: If I were in
their position, I'd be like,

765
00:35:48,923 --> 00:35:51,391
"okay, I have to study
'Game of Thrones, '"

766
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:54,244
but I'm also really
obsessive-compulsive about spoilers,

767
00:35:54,295 --> 00:35:57,030
and I wouldn't want to spoil
myself just to win a challenge.

768
00:35:57,048 --> 00:36:00,534
The correct answer
is knight of the king's guard.

769
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:03,337
Kelsey,
you are about to fly again.

770
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:05,806
Okay, but this is the problem...
she needs actually a score.

771
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,978
Ready... Set... Go!

772
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,562
Bobby: Okay, Kelsey.

773
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:14,848
Curtis: She's reaching
early for the vials.

774
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:17,351
And she hasn't even...
now she's approaching.

775
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,551
Oh! And she misses!

776
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:20,520
She got one!
She got one... 100.

777
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:22,823
Kelsey is now tied with Chris.

778
00:36:22,857 --> 00:36:24,825
Oh! Just misses a 250!

779
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:26,076
Ohh!

780
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,594
Kelsey has just pulled ahead
350 to 100!

781
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:32,449
[Speaking Japanese] Awesome!

782
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,951
This is the last question.

783
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:37,571
Chris, you must answer correctly
for a chance to win.

784
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:46,346
One cauldron, pewter.

785
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:48,915
One plain, pointed hat.

786
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:51,852
One owl, any breed of choice.

787
00:36:51,886 --> 00:36:55,856
One copy of "magical theory"
by adalbert waffling.

788
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:58,291
Come on, Kelsey.

789
00:36:58,326 --> 00:37:00,978
Chris knows a lot, but fantasy?

790
00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:02,829
Chris doesn't even know
what a dungeon master is.

791
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,531
How do you get into Nerdvana

792
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:07,367
without knowing what
a flippin' dungeon master does?

793
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:11,738
So, this is the perfect
opportunity to get rid of him.

794
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:12,990
Reveal.

795
00:37:13,992 --> 00:37:18,412
And the answer is
one owl, any breed of choice.

796
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:19,830
You will both go flying.

797
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:21,982
Chris, you'll fly first.

798
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:25,335
The only reason I'm in this game
is because I studied my butt off

799
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,471
when it came to
"Harry Potter" questions.

800
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:29,840
[Contestants cheering]

801
00:37:29,891 --> 00:37:33,427
Xander: If we lose Chris, it would
be a huge blow to the titans.

802
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:36,163
We're putting a lot of stock
in him keeping us together.

803
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,631
Set... Go!

804
00:37:43,824 --> 00:37:45,709
Katie: It's Titan time!

805
00:37:45,793 --> 00:37:46,910
[Contestants cheering]

806
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:48,995
Josh: The result
of this Nerd-Off is big.

807
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:51,298
If they lose Chris,
they lose their leader.

808
00:37:51,332 --> 00:37:53,300
We want them to be in chaos.

809
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:55,619
Ready... Set... Go!

810
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:58,638
- And he's off, Curtis.
- Yep.

811
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:00,590
Chris is down by 250 points

812
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:03,310
and has to make it up here
on the final run.

813
00:38:03,344 --> 00:38:05,862
And... He throws.

814
00:38:05,897 --> 00:38:08,014
- Misses the 100.
- Misses the 100.

815
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:10,016
[Chanting] Chris! Chris! Chris!

816
00:38:10,084 --> 00:38:12,352
- Misses the 200.
- Misses the 200.

817
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:15,071
And it's 500! An amazing shot!

818
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:17,090
And Chris has taken the lead!

819
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:21,394
Chris has risen from the
cauldron of his father's bones

820
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:25,782
and the blood of his enemies
like lord Voldemort.

821
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:30,403
Kelsey, you're gonna
have to make 250 points.

822
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:32,789
Mary Kate:
If Chris ends up winning,

823
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,208
just like Newton's third law
of motion...

824
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:38,795
with every action, there's an
opposite and equal reaction...

825
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:41,381
and I'm just worried about the
reaction that we're gonna get.

826
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:43,183
Let's do it!

827
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:45,018
Go!

828
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:48,855
You can see the concentration
in her face now, Bobby.

829
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:50,140
She's really focused.

830
00:38:50,191 --> 00:38:51,758
Bobby: She's serious this time.

831
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,610
She's already taken
one of the vials out.

832
00:38:53,644 --> 00:38:55,946
She's approaching
the 100 cauldrons.

833
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,931
And she got one in!

834
00:38:57,965 --> 00:39:00,283
Kelsey's one cauldron
away from victory!

835
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:02,935
And she missed the second!

836
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:07,106
She'll have one more chance
at this 500-point cauldron.

837
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:08,941
And she missed the third!

838
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,412
Kelsey has come up short,
which means, Chris,

839
00:39:12,446 --> 00:39:16,967
you have won this Nerd-Off!

840
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:19,135
[Cheers and applause] Oh, my.

841
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,255
I'm going back to Nerdvana,
and I'm going for the gold team.

842
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:24,674
You will receive Texas justice.

843
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:28,261
Jack: Chris, you swallowed
a bottle of Felix felicis.

844
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:31,815
That's the luck potion
in "Harry Potter."

845
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:35,835
Kelsey, while the sun may set
for you here at Nerdvana,

846
00:39:35,903 --> 00:39:40,473
we know that you will always be one
with the land of the rising sun.

847
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:46,446
So fly off, Kelsey, to all that
the future will hold for you.

848
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,115
I can't wait. [Chuckles]

849
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:51,117
Brian: The Titans of Rigel...

850
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:53,386
we stand on the shoulders
of our predecessors,

851
00:39:53,454 --> 00:39:57,374
and Kelsey becomes
one of our predecessors.

852

Ja ne! Minasan,
arigatou gozaimasu!

Ganbarimasu!

00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:07,166
Brian: It's an honor for us to be
able to stand on her shoulder.

855
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:10,103
On the other hand,
nobody wants to be the shoulder.

856
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,365
Kayla: Being able
to actually talk to people,

857
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,452
get out of my computer
and my books,

858
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:28,488
it's just
such a fascinating experience.

859
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:31,157
And these are
all <i>amazing</i> people.

860
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,860
And Nerdvana was like
its own mini-world.

861
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:38,197
You know, "chiisai sekai"...
its own "little, tiny world."

862
00:40:38,215 --> 00:40:41,034
And, oh, my goodness,
what a world to be in.

863
00:40:41,102 --> 00:40:44,421
[Speaking Japanese]
Do your best, my new friends!

864
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:46,756
She was unique.

She was.
